# Background

The data analysis on the following pages seeks to investigate the relationship, if any  between various financial factors and their impact on student achievement. We first began our investigation by acquiring student achievement data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress, which is an organization that measures what U.S. students know and can do in various subjects across the nation, in each individual state. This assessment is given every two years to a representative sample of students across the country. For our research purposes, we narrowed down the data and looked at average reading and math scores in grades 4 and 8 across each of the 50 states during the 2013, 2015, and 2017 testing years.
After gathering the average score data from the NAEP, total revenue (federal and state sources), and total instructional spending from the USED, we then collected financial data from the US Census Bureau on median household income, poverty rate for each of the 50 states.
Our mission: to find a correlation, or lack thereof, between these financial variables and the impact on student achievement in order to better inform education policy makers and stakeholders in the future.
